# ErrorCodeStore state

## Procedure
`ErrorCodeStore` is a combined error code for handling the `CodeStoreOutOfGas` and `MaxCodeSizeExceeded` code store related errors. This type of error only occurs when executing `CREATE`/`CREATE2` opcode or a deployment transaction (tx.to = null).

### EVM behavior
While handling a `CREATE`/`CREATE2` opcode, initial bytecode will be executed and then current call context is created. The contract bytecode will be returned through `RETURN` opcode as the execution result. `RETURN` returns a specified memory chunk [`offset`...`offset` + `length`] as bytecode. The gas cost for storing the bytecode is:

```
let CODE_DEPOSIT_BYTE_COST = 200
code_store_cost = CODE_DEPOSIT_BYTE_COST * len(bytecodes)
``` 

- If `code_store_cost` > gas left, it is `CodeStoreOutOfGas` case.
- If returned bytecode length > `MAXCODESIZE`, it is `MaxCodeSizeExceeded` case.  

On the circuit bus mapping side, the checks for these two code store errors are [here](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits/blob/8a633f7c3de2da72f0817def57c1703241cced97/bus-mapping/src/circuit_input_builder/input_state_ref.rs#L1296-L1304). This error happens only when current opcode is `RETURN` and it's a `CREATE`/`CREATE2` call (`call.is_create == true`). We can't get contract bytecode length in `CREATE`/`CREATE2` opcodes and it's only available in `RETURN` opcode so we handle these two errors in `RETURN` opcode.

Overall it looks like the following:  
- Pop EVM word `offset` and `length` from the stack, 
- Go to `ErrorCodeStore` state when call context is being created & select which one of the followings occurs:
  1. Storing `length` of bytecode runs out of gas.
  2. `length` of bytecode exceeds `MAXCODESIZE`.

### Constraints
1. Current opcode is `RETURN` and `is_create` is `True`.
2. `code_store_cost` > gas_left or `length` > `MAXCODESIZE`
3. Current call must be failed.
4. Current call is not static call.
5. If it's a root call, it transits to `EndTx`
6. if it is not root call, it restores caller's context by reading to `rw_table`, then does step state transition to it.

### Lookups
- Byte code lookup.
- Stack reads for `offset` and `length`. 
- Call context lookups for `is_success` and `rw_counter_end_of_reversion`.
- Restore context lookups for non-root call.
