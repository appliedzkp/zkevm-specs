# State Proof

The state proof helps EVM proof to check all the random read-write access records are valid, through grouping them by their unique index first, and then sorting them by order of access. We call the order of access `GlobalCounter`, which counts the number of access records and also serves as an unique identifier for a record. When state proof is generated, the `BusMapping` is also produced and will be shared to EVM proof as a lookup table.

## Random Read-Write Data

State proof maintains the read-write part of [random accessible data](./evm-proof.md#Random-Accessible-Data) of EVM proof:

| Target                                | Index             | Description                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [`AccountNonce`](#AccountNonce)       | `{address}`       | Account's nonce                          |
| [`AccountBalance`](#AccountBalance)   | `{address}`       | Account's balance                        |
| [`AccountCodeHash`](#AccountCodeHash) | `{address}`       | Account's code hash                      |
| [`AccountStorage`](#AccountStorage)   | `{address}.{key}` | Account's storage as a key-value mapping |
| [`CallState`](#CallState)             | `{id}.{enum}`     | Call's internal state                    |
| [`CallStateStack`](#CallStateStack)   | `{id}.{index}`    | Call's stack as a encoded word array     |
| [`CallStateMemory`](#CallStateMemory) | `{id}.{index}`    | Call's memory as a byte array            |

The concatenation of **Target** and **Index** becomes the unique index for data. Each record will be attached with a `GlobalCounter`, and the records are constraint to be in group by their unique index first and to be sorted by their `GlobalCounter` increasingly. Given the access to previous record, each target has their own format and rules to update, for example, `AccountNonce` always increase by 1, and values in `CallStateMemory` should fit in 8-bit.

## Constants

| Name                 | Value              | Description                                                                               |

| `MAX_U8`             | `2**8 - 1 (255)`   | Maximum value of u8 (byte)                                                                |
| `MAX_STACK_INDEX`    | `2**10 - 1 (1023)` | Maximum index of stack (EVM has maximum stack size 1024)                                  |
| `MAX_GLOBAL_COUNTER` | `2**25 - 1`        | Maximum number of `GlobalCounter`, which is also the maximum degree of polynomial allowed |

## Circuit Constraints

The following part describes the custom constraints for each target by a python script. There are some common helper class and function:

```python
class RW(Enum):
    Read: int = 0
    Write: int = 1

    def __sub__(self, _):
        return None


class Record:
    fields: Tuple[str]
    values: object

    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        self.values = {}
        self.fields = tuple(['global_counter', 'rw'] + self.fields)
        for field in self.fields:
            self.values[field] = kwargs[field]
            setattr(self, field, self.values[field])

    def __sub__(self, rhs):
        if rhs is None:
            return self
        return type(self)(**{field: self.values[field] - rhs.values[field] for field in self.fields})


class ReadWriteGate:
    group_fields: Tuple[(str, Callable)]

    def constraint(self, prev, cur):
        diff = cur - prev

        is_first_row = prev is None
        is_first_row_in_group = is_first_row or \
            any([getattr(diff, field) != 0 for field, _ in self.group_fields])

        # grouping
        if not is_first_row:
            for field, group_fn in self.group_fields:
                assert(group_fn(cur, prev, diff))
                if getattr(diff, field) != 0:
                    break

        # rw should be valid
        assert cur.rw in (RW.Read, RW.Write)

        # global counter should increase in group
        if not is_first_row_in_group:
            assert 0 < diff.global_counter <= MAX_GLOBAL_COUNTER

        type(self).constraint_every_row(cur)
        type(self).constraint_in_group(prev, cur, diff, is_first_row_in_group)

    @abstractclassmethod
    def constraint_every_row(cur):

    ]

    def constraint_every_row(cur: AccountNonce):
        # rw should be a Write (currently evm doesn't support read nonce)
        assert cur.rw == RW.Write

        # NOTE: we don't need to check each address is in [0, 2**160) becasue in
        #       evm circuit it always decompress the address into bytes, which might
        #       come from stack or tx. In both case, evm takes masked value, so evm
        #       circuit only cares first 20 bytes, which will always be in range.
