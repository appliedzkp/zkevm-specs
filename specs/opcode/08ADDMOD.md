# ADDMOD opcode

## Procedure

### EVM behavior

Pop three EVM words `a`, `b` and `n` from the stack.

If n is zero
	push 0 into the stack
else
	compute `r = (a + b) mod n`, and push `r` into to the stack

### Circuit behavior

The AddModGadget takes argument of `a: [u8;32]`, `b: [u8;32]`, `n: [u8;32]` and keeps a cell for storing `d :[u8;32]`

- Check the equality `a + b == r + d * n` with carry check (1)
- Check that `r<n` (2)

To handle the case of `n==0` => `r==0`, if n is zero

- witness `r ‚Üê (a + b) % 2^256` to satisfy &1 
- deactivate &2

## Constraints

1. opcodeId checks
   opId === OpcodeId(0x08)
2. state transition:
   - gc + 4
   - stack_pointer + 2
   - pc + 1
   - gas + 8
3. Lookups: 4 busmapping lookups
   - `a` is at the top of the stack
   - `b` is at the second position of the stack
   - `n` is at the third position of the stack
   - `r`, the result, is at the new top of the stack

## Exceptions

1. stack underflow: `1022 <= stack_pointer <= 1024`
2. out of gas: remaining gas is not enough
