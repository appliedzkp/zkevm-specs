# Coinbase op code

## Procedure

The `COINBASE` opcode get the coinbase address from current block and push to the stack

## EVM behavior

The `COINBASE` opcode loads an `address` (20 bytes of data) from block context.
then push the `address` to the stack.

## Circuit behavior

1. construct block context table
2. do busmapping lookup for stack write operation
3. other implicit check: bytes length

## Constraints

1. opId = 0x41
2. State transition:
   - gc + 1 (1 stack write)
   - stack_pointer - 1
   - pc + 1
   - gas + 2
3. Lookups:  2
   - `address` is on the top of stack
   - `address` is in the block context table
4. Others:
   - `address` is 20 bytes length

## Exceptions

1. stack overflow: stack is full, stack pointer = 0
2. out of gas: remaining gas is not enough
