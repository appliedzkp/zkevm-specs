# MULMOD opcode

## Procedure

### EVM behavior


Pop 3 EVM words `a`, `b` and `N` from the stack.

If `N` is 0:
	push 0 into the stack.
else:
	compute `r= (a * b) mod N` and push `r` into the stack.

*Note*
All intermediate calculations of this operation are not subject to the 2^256 modulo.

### Circuit behavior

The MulModGadget takes arguments:
 - `a: [u8;32]`
 - `b: [u8;32]`,
 - `N: [u8;32]`,
and keeps 5 cells for storing `k1: [u8;32]`,  `k2: [u8;32]`, `a_reduced: [u8;32]` ,
 `e: [u8;32]`, `d: [u8;32]`.

- Check the equality ` k1 * N + a_reduced  == a ` (1)
- Check the equality ` a_reduced * b = k2 * N + r` (2)


```
TODO: Circuit gadgets description
```

- Check `r<n` (3)

To handle the case of `n==0` => `r==0`, if `N` is 0:

- witness `r <= a * b % 2^256` to satisfy (1)
- deactivate (3)


## Constraints

1. opcodeID checks
   opId == OpcodeId(0x09)
2. state transition:
   - gc + 4
   - stack_pointer +2
   - pc + 1
   - gas + 8
3. Lookups: 4 busmapping lookups
   - `a` is on top of the stack.
   - `b` is in the second position of the stack.
   - `N` is in the third position of the stack.
   - `r`, the result is on top of the new stack.


## Exceptions

1. stack undeflow: `1022 <= stack_pointer <= 1024`.
2. out of gas: Remaining gas is not enough.
